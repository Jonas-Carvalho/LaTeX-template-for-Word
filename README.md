LaTeX-template-for-Word
=======================

Many people lack a good template for writing academic lab reports and therefore, I am sharingmy LaTeX like template in Word. 
LaTeX is a typesetting language used primarily in academic environments. 
Characteristics of a LaTeX report is often numbered headings, a special font (computer modern) and wide margins. 
The benefits of LaTeX are numerous but sometimes it can be more time efficient to write the report in Word.

Example of report written with this template:

### Install ###
1. Download and install the Computer Modern Fonts at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cm-unicode/files/cm-unicode/0.7.0/
2. Download this template. Either open it and start writing or apply the template to an already existing document. 
Both should work fine.
